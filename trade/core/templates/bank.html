            <h2>Introduction to Central Banks</h2>
            <p>Central banks are financial institutions with the primary responsibility of managing a country's money supply, controlling interest rates, and ensuring the stability of the national currency. In the context of the forex market, central banks play a pivotal role in influencing currency values through various monetary policy tools.</p>
            <p>Central banks are typically independent entities, tasked with maintaining economic stability and avoiding excessive inflation or deflation. They achieve these objectives through the implementation of monetary policies and interventions in financial markets.</p>

            <h2>Monetary Policy and Interest Rates</h2>
            <p>One of the primary tools central banks use to influence the forex market is the control of interest rates. By adjusting interest rates, central banks can affect borrowing costs, inflation levels, and overall economic activity.</p>
            <p>For example, if a central bank decides to raise interest rates, it may attract foreign capital seeking higher returns, leading to an appreciation of the national currency. Conversely, lowering interest rates can stimulate economic growth but may result in a depreciation of the currency.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Foreign Exchange Reserves</h2>
            <p>Central banks maintain foreign exchange reserves, consisting of foreign currencies and other assets. These reserves act as a financial cushion and can be used to stabilize the domestic currency in times of economic uncertainty.</p>
            <p>By strategically buying or selling currencies, central banks can influence exchange rates and mitigate extreme fluctuations. A strong reserve position enhances a central bank's ability to maintain currency stability.</p>

            <h2>Intervention in Forex Markets</h2>
            <p>Central banks may intervene directly in the forex market to address specific issues. Direct interventions involve buying or selling currencies to influence exchange rates and counteract excessive volatility or an overvalued/undervalued currency.</p>
            <p>Indirect interventions may include verbal interventions through official statements or communication from central bank officials. Verbal interventions aim to influence market sentiment and guide expectations without direct market transactions.</p>

            <h2>Forward Guidance</h2>
            <p>Central banks provide forward guidance by communicating their future policy intentions. This communication is often delivered through official statements, press conferences, or publications.</p>
            <p>Forex traders closely monitor forward guidance as it provides insights into the central bank's outlook on economic conditions and potential future policy actions. Changes in language or tone during these communications can significantly impact currency movements.</p>
