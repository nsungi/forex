        <section>
            <h2>Fundamental Analysis</h2>
            <p>Fundamental analysis involves evaluating economic, political, and social factors that may affect currency values. Key components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Indicators:</strong> Assess indicators such as GDP growth, employment rates, and inflation to gauge a country's economic health.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Monitor central bank decisions on interest rates, as they impact currency values.</li>
                <li><strong>Political Stability:</strong> Consider the political climate and stability of countries, as political events can influence currency markets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Fundamental analysis provides a macro-level view of currency movements and helps traders understand the broader economic context.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a country's GDP growth is robust, it might attract foreign investment, leading to a stronger currency. Conversely, political unrest can weaken a currency. <a href="{% url 'fundamental' %}">read more</a></p>

        <section>
            <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
            <p>Technical analysis involves studying price charts and using various tools to predict future price movements. Components of technical analysis include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Candlestick Patterns:</strong> Identify patterns that indicate market sentiment, such as doji, engulfing, and hammer patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Support and Resistance:</strong> Identify key levels where the price has historically had a difficult time breaking through.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicators:</strong> Use technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and MACD for trend analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Technical analysis provides a micro-level view of price movements and helps traders make tactical decisions based on historical patterns.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A break above a strong resistance level may signal a potential upward trend continuation, while a pattern like a double top might suggest a reversal. <a href="{% url 'technical' %}">read more</a></p>
