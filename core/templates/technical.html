            <h2>Introduction to Technical Analysis</h2>
            <p>Technical analysis is a comprehensive method used by traders to evaluate and predict price movements in financial markets. It involves the study of historical price data and trading volumes to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make informed trading decisions.</p>
            <p>Key principles of technical analysis include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price Discounts Everything:</strong> All known information is reflected in the price of an asset. Traders use this principle to assess the impact of news and events on market prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Price Moves in Trends:</strong> Prices tend to move in trends that can be identified and analyzed. Traders seek to align their strategies with the prevailing trend to maximize profitability.</li>
                <li><strong>History Tends to Repeat Itself:</strong> Patterns observed in the past may repeat in the future. Recognizing these patterns allows traders to anticipate potential market movements.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Technical analysis is widely used in the forex market to gain insights into potential price movements and make well-informed trading decisions.</p>

            <h2>Technical Analysis Tools</h2>
            <p>Traders use various tools and techniques for technical analysis. These tools help them interpret price charts and identify potential trading opportunities. Some common tools include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Candlestick Patterns:</strong> Candlestick charts display price movements and patterns using candlestick formations. Traders analyze these patterns to gauge market sentiment and potential reversals.</li>
                <li><strong>Support and Resistance Levels:</strong> These are key levels at which an asset's price has historically had a hard time moving above (resistance) or below (support). Traders use these levels to identify potential entry and exit points.</li>
                <li><strong>Chart Patterns:</strong> Patterns such as triangles, flags, and head and shoulders formations are analyzed for potential trend reversals or continuations. These patterns provide valuable information about market dynamics.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Indicators:</strong> Indicators like Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) provide additional insights into market trends and momentum. Traders use these indicators to confirm signals and make informed decisions.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>Each tool serves a specific purpose in technical analysis, and traders often use a combination of these tools to enhance their analytical capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Chart Patterns</h2>
            <p>Chart patterns are formations that appear on price charts and can provide insights into potential future price movements. Traders study these patterns to anticipate market behavior and make strategic trading decisions. Some common chart patterns include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Head and Shoulders:</strong> A reversal pattern indicating a potential trend change. Traders look for the formation of a head and shoulders pattern to anticipate a shift in market direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Top and Double Bottom:</strong> Reversal patterns often signaling a change in trend direction. A double top suggests a potential downtrend, while a double bottom indicates a potential uptrend.</li>
                <li><strong>Triangles:</strong> Symmetrical, ascending, and descending triangles can indicate consolidation and potential breakouts. Traders analyze triangle patterns to identify potential entry points for trades.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Indicators</h2>
            <p>Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on historical price, volume, or open interest. They provide traders with additional information about market trends, momentum, and potential reversal points. Some commonly used indicators include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong> Smoothed averages that help identify the direction of the trend. Traders use moving averages to filter out noise and identify the prevailing market trend.</li>
                <li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> Measures the speed and change of price movements, indicating overbought or oversold conditions. Traders use RSI to assess the strength of a trend and potential reversal points.</li>
                <li><strong>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):</strong> A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. Traders use MACD to identify changes in momentum and potential trend reversals.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="{% static 'assets/dist/img/technical analysis.jpg' %}" alt="Technical Indicators" />
            <p>By incorporating technical indicators into their analysis, traders gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics and can make more informed decisions. These indicators act as valuable tools for assessing the strength and direction of trends.</p>
